# Dush

Dush - **D**eveloper's **u**seful **s**cripts **h**ive - is a collection of scripts I use for my software development work. It contains a reusable framework for building scripting environments for specific projects. Most projects I actually use are not pushed to this repository, because they contain company confidential data. Still, the framework is generic and can be reused for any opensource project, which requires non-trivial building steps or other operations.
